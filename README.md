# Empty_Gif_Making_Sketch_for_p5.js
Empty p5 Sketch for making gifs!

__________________________________________


Empty p5.js sketch using CCapture to make a gif of the sketch !

in order to make a gif you need to set the 'recording' variable to true, and you can set the number of frame in the gif with the 'gifLength' variable (in sketch.js).
In index.html you can change the framerate of the gif.


## Warning
With recent changes, you'll need to set up a local server for the project to work
